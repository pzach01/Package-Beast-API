### PETER: start at the line below, everything else is matplotlib specific but could give you an idea how to 
# packageList is a list of lists where the inner list contains a 
binList,packageList=box_stuff2.master_calculate_optimal_solution(bins,boxes)
print(packageList)

# this is matplotlib specific, doubt you will use this other then to see how I rendered it
#rendering.render_bin(binList[0],packageList[0])
